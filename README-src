 COMPILING THE SOURCES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You should be able to compile this code with zero (or few) modifications
using GNU GCC compilers (or compatible). For the Windows version, you can
use use MinGW (www.mingw.org).

First, make sure you have installed these libraries and their dependancies:
* SDL (v1.2.7)
* SDL_Image (v1.2.2)
* SDL_Mixer

I used the beforementioned versions, but you can build the game using other versions
too.

When you're done installing the libs, simply type 'make' and
the game should build all right.

Additionally, you can adjust the default directories where the game looks it's
data by editing the 'makefile' and rebuilding the game.
